      "First aid is the immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery. Here's an overview of key first aid techniques and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Assess the Situation:\n",
      "- Ensure the scene is safe for you and the injured person.\n",
      "- Do not put yourself in danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Call for Help:\n",
      "- If the situation is serious, call emergency services immediately.\n",
      "- Provide them with clear and concise information about the location and the condition of the person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check for Responsiveness:\n",
      "- Gently shake the person and shout to see if they respond.\n",
      "- If there is no response, check their airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABCs of first aid).\n",
      "\n",
      "CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation):\n",
      "- If the person is not breathing, start CPR.\n",
      "- Place the heel of your hand on the center of the chest, place the other hand on top, and press down hard and fast (about 2 inches deep, 100-120 compressions per minute).\n",
      "\n",
      "Control Bleeding:\n",
      "- Apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage.\n",
      "- If bleeding is severe, continue to apply pressure and seek professional help immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treating Shock:\n",
      "- Lay the person down and elevate their legs slightly.\n",
      "- Keep them warm and calm until help arrives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wound Care:\n",
      "- Clean the wound with clean water.\n",
      "- Apply an antiseptic and cover it with a sterile bandage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns:\n",
      "- Cool the burn under running water for at least 10 minutes.\n",
      "- Cover with a non-stick, sterile bandage or cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choking:\n",
      "- If a person is choking, perform the Heimlich maneuver by standing behind them, placing your arms around their waist, and pulling inward and upward just above their navel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fractures:\n",
      "- Immobilize the injured area.\n",
      "- Avoid moving the person if you suspect a spinal injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poisoning:\n",
      "- Identify the poison and call emergency services.\n",
